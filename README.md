## Introduction 

The purpose of this project is to promote Co. Kerry in Ireland to prospective visitors and tourists. This is done through captivating and stunning imagery of the landscape
and a detailed description of places to visit and activities to do. It's a 3-page website consisting of a home page, see and do page and a contact page, with an option
to download a brochure and make enquiries for further information. The project will have a broad target market and isn't targeted to any specific cohort of tourists.

The project incorporates a simple, intuitive design provide optimal user experience and produces a real-life demonstration of my development expertise for my interactive frontend 
development milestone project. Itâ€™s designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential customers. The project can be further 
enhanced and built on to incorporate hotel, room and travel booking functionalities.

## UX 

### Business Goals 

- The principal purpose of this site is to market Kerry as an amazing holiday destination. 
- Provide a good user experience. 
- Provide clear information on places to visit, with engaging and captivating imagery, and things to do.

- Provide an interactive map for site users with locations and corresponding descriptions.

### User Goals

- View the scenery and landscape through imagery.
- Intuitive site navigation. 


#### Interaction design

- Visually pleasing displays. 
- Low number of steps to book a travel consultation or contact.
- The interface interacts with user actions as expected, the scroll/swipe actions respond with the normal behaviour and buttons acts instantly on press. These features generate a predictable

- The content is organised and prioritised by importance from top to bottom and left to right in terms of position on the page. 

### Wireframes 

Home Page - **[View](./assets/wireframes/homepage.png)** 

See & Do - **[View](./assets/wireframes/see&do.png)**

Contact Us - **[View](./assets/wireframes/contact.png)**

- These were the initial wireframes created during the project inception phase. As the project and my skills evolved, so too did the design of the site, hence, the wireframes do not exactly mirror the 
  final project.


## Design


### Typography

- The ABeeZee font was the chosen font for the body of this site with Sans Serif as the safe alternative in the case of ABeeZee not being imported 

- ABeeZee is a widespread and visually-pleasing font style. ABeeZee is an open, friendly and simple font developed by Google. I have seen it utilised
  effectively in a number of similar informational websites during my research, and therefore selected it for this project.

### Imagery 

- The imagery selected is a key feature for attracting prospective visitors and tourists. The large carousel on the home page comprising of three images (see example below) is designed to be captivating, attention-grabbing and
to show an example of the pictureque landscape that Kerry beholds. The purpose of the beautiful imagery is to nurture interest in the area and entice those with an interest in sightseeing or landscapes
into booking a visit or seeking further information.

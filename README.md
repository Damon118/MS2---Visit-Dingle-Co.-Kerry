## Introduction 

The purpose of this project is to promote Co. Kerry in Ireland to prospective visitors and tourists. This is done through captivating and stunning imagery of the landscape
and a detailed description of places to visit and activities to do. It's a 3-page website consisting of a home page, see and do page and a contact page, with an option
to download a brochure and make enquiries for further information. The project will have a broad target market and isn't targeted to any specific cohort of tourists.

The project incorporates a simple, intuitive design provide optimal user experience and produces a real-life demonstration of my development expertise for my interactive frontend 
development milestone project. Itâ€™s designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential customers. The project can be further 
enhanced and built on to incorporate hotel, room and travel booking functionalities.

The UX is simple, user-friendly and intuitive, providing an ease of navigation through the site.

### 2. Scope

- Interactive elements that showcase places to visit and activities to do in Kerry.
- The website has a contact form for any enquiries and social media links to follow.

### 3. Structure 

- The site is organised into three pages.
- The navbar is fixed at the top of the screen and allows the user to navigate to each page. The current page is highlighted in the navbar and the site logo
  links to the home page.
- The carousel on the home page showcases some example of the scenery in Kerry.
- The introduction paragraph on the home page gives the user a brief synopsis on the county. 
- The second page is interactive and the user can make choices about what content is displayed and where they are viewing on the map.
- The content is clearly divided into sections so the user is clear on what the information they are viewing relates to.
- The website contains a form for enquiries.
- The footer has copyright information, a button that links to the contact form and social media links.

#### Interaction design

- Responsive and accesible on a range of devices. 
- Visually pleasing displays. 
- Low number of steps to book a travel consultation or contact.
- The interface interacts with user actions as expected, the scroll/swipe actions respond with the normal behaviour and buttons acts instantly on press. These features generate a predictable
  feel for the user.


#### Information architecture 

- Constructed with a focus on simplicity, so that no extraneous information and functionality is present and overload is avoided.
- The content is organised and prioritised by importance from top to bottom and left to right in terms of position on the page. 

### 4. Skeleton

- Footer with button bringing user to contact form and social media icons.

#### Wireframes 

Home Page - **[View](./assets/wireframes/homepage.png)** 

See & Do - **[View](./assets/wireframes/see&do.png)**

Contact Us - **[View](./assets/wireframes/contact.png)**

- These were the initial wireframes created during the project inception phase. As the project and my skills evolved, so too did the design of the site, hence, the wireframes do not exactly mirror the 
  final project.

### 5. Surface


#### Typography

- The ABeeZee font was the chosen font for the body of this site with Sans Serif as the safe alternative in the case of ABeeZee not being imported 

- ABeeZee is a widespread and visually-pleasing font style. ABeeZee is an open, friendly and simple font developed by Google. I have seen it utilised
  effectively in a number of similar informational websites during my research, and therefore selected it for this project.

#### Imagery 

- The imagery selected is a key feature for attracting prospective visitors and tourists. The large carousel on the home page comprising of three images (see example below) is designed to be captivating, attention-grabbing and
to show an example of the pictureque landscape that Kerry beholds. The purpose of the beautiful imagery is to nurture interest in the area and entice those with an interest in sightseeing or landscapes
into booking a visit or seeking further information.

#### Colour Schemes

- The colours were chosen as they provide an appealing user interface and complement the imagery. The colours are soft, to match the the theme of the website - nature and beauty.

- Green is also one of the official colours of Kerry and indeed, Ireland. The lighter shade of green (#cdfccd) selected for the header, footer and background of the introudction paragraph augments the
  site content and doesn't detract from the images. To keep the colours in alignment with the site theme, and in harmony with the background image, a light and welcoming shade of blue (#8cdbf3b9) was chosen as the colour
  for the contact form.
